# Machine Learning Project: ECG Health Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on using Machine Learning techniques to classify Electrocardiogram (ECG) data as either healthy or unhealthy. We employed a Transformer model to analyze the ECG signals and make predictions regarding their health status. The model was trained using Python and TensorFlow, with variations including Transformer architectures with both 32 and 16 attention heads.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of ECG signals obtained from various sources. Each signal is labeled as either healthy or unhealthy based on medical assessments. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and prepare the data for training.

## Model Architecture

We experimented with different variations of the Transformer model architecture to find the most effective approach for ECG signal classification. Two main configurations were explored:

1. Transformer Model with 32 Attention Heads
2. Transformer Model with 16 Attention Heads

The models are trained using the labeled ECG data to learn patterns indicative of healthy and unhealthy signals.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework. The codebase consists of several modules:

- **data_processing.py**: Contains functions for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and dataset preparation.
- **model.py**: Defines the Transformer model architectures with different attention head configurations.
- **train.py**: Handles the training procedure, including model training, validation, and evaluation.
- **evaluate.py**: Provides functions for model evaluation on test data and generating performance metrics.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions used across different modules.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your ECG dataset or use a provided dataset.
3. Preprocess the data using `data_processing.py`.
4. Train the model using `train.py`, specifying the desired model architecture and hyperparameters.
5. Evaluate the trained model using `evaluate.py` on test data.

## Results

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results are presented in tabular format and can be found in the `results` directory.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the feasibility of using Transformer models for ECG signal classification. By experimenting with different attention head configurations, we explored the impact of model architecture on classification performance. Further optimizations and fine-tuning may improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
